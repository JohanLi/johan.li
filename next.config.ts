   For pages that Next.js deems static, an s-maxage of 1 year and ETag are set. However, I've been unable to
   get ETags to properly work with Cloudflare in front.

   As a workaround, I'm overriding s-maxage to 1 hour by exporting `revalidate = 1800`.
   Next.js also sets a stale-while-revalidate of 1 year, but to my best knowledge, Cloudflare doesn't respect this/or
   it serves stale content already by default.
